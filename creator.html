    <h1>The Story Behind KeepsVault</h1>
    
    <div class="card">
      <h2>How it all began</h2>
      <p>KeepsVault started from a simple frustration that I think many of us share: the chaos of important documents scattered everywhere.</p>
      
      <p>I was helping my parents organize their paperwork when I realized there had to be a better way. Passports, medical records, insurance documents, warranties - all these important things were in different places, making it impossible to find what we needed when we needed it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The problem we're solving</h2>
      <p>Every family faces the same challenges:</p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li><strong>Lost documents:</strong> Important papers get misplaced or forgotten</li>
        <li><strong>Scattered information:</strong> Family details spread across multiple apps and files</li>
        <li><strong>Sharing difficulties:</strong> Hard to safely share documents with family or professionals</li>
        <li><strong>Missed deadlines:</strong> Renewals and appointments forgotten</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why I built this</h2>
      <p>I wanted to create something that would:</p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li><strong>Simplify life:</strong> One place for everything important</li>
        <li><strong>Keep families safe:</strong> Emergency information always accessible</li>
        <li><strong>Respect privacy:</strong> Your data stays yours, shared only when you choose</li>
        <li><strong>Work everywhere:</strong> Access from any device, anywhere in the world</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Our values</h2>
      <p>KeepsVault is built on three core principles:</p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li><strong>Privacy first:</strong> We believe your personal information should remain private and secure</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Technology should make life easier, not more complicated</li>
        <li><strong>Global accessibility:</strong> Everyone deserves secure document management, regardless of where they live</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Join the journey</h2>
      <p>This is just the beginning. I'm building KeepsVault to help families around the world organize their lives better. Whether you're in New York, London, Tokyo, or anywhere else, I want this tool to work for you.</p>
